IAddNewsViaEmail
===============

This integrates with redmine and lets news and comments for news creation via email.
Created with Rails 2.3.5 and Redmine 0.8.4


Example
=======

Make sure You have the permissions to manage news (or comment news).

For creating news, send an email (almost the same as issue creation via email)

start_sample:
Project: project_identifier
Summary: one line summary, may contain spaces, optional
Type: news
This is just a
multiline
description of the news.
end_sample.

Summary is not mandatory. Title comes from email subject. Type and Project are mandatory, case sensitive. 
Description is also mandatory (at least one symbol, this is a rule set by Redmine).

To comment on news: just push the reply button, when You have been notified about the news via email. 

Notifications should be enabled in Administration/Settings/Email Notifications.
